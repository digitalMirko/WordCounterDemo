Android Word Counter Demo

App created in Android Studio 3.0.1 and tested on a Genymotion Google Nexus 5X Android Emulator then on a Motorola Moto X Developer Edition Android phone.

To use this app the user just clicks the 'Word Counter Demo' app icon and they are taken right into the app. 
They are greeted with a title ('Word Counter Demo')on the top. Then right below is shown a textview which is blank and under that
is a full screen PlainText area which has a hint ('type in your text to get a count') for the user to type in some text to get the word count. As the user clicks in the PlainText area a pop up keyboard pops up. As they finish each word it is added to the text count right above the text. The quote used in the demo was from Allen Ginsberg's "Howl': "angelheaded hipsters burning for the ancient heavenly
connection to the starry dynamo in the machinery of the night"

The default line in the PlainText area has been hidden by using the following line android:background="@android:color/transparent" in the
activity_main.xml <EditText> area. Usually the line would be shown on the bottom of the PlainText box. The gravity is set to top|center.
